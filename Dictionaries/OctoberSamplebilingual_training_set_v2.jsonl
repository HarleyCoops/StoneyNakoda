What specific grammatical function does the prefix `î-` perform here, as implied by their classifications and meanings?", "answer": "The prefix `î-` in `îborâch` indicates a first-person plural subject ('we') and marks the verb as transitive.

What does this grammatical classification imply about how these concepts are typically expressed in Stoney Nakoda compared to an action verb?", "answer": "Being classified as 'stative verbs' means they describe a state or condition rather than an active process.
